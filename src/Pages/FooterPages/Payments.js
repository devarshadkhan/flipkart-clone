                  Flipkart realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection
                  and resolution capability. We and our online payments partners
                  monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and
                  flag potentially fraudulent transactions for manual
                  verification by our team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is unable to rule
                  out the possibility of fraud categorically, the transaction is
                  kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide
                  identity documents. The ID documents help us ensure that the
                  purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We
                  apologise for any inconvenience that may be caused to
                  customers and request them to bear with us in the larger
                  interest of ensuring a safe and secure environment for online
